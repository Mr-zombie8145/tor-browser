### Updating Gradle Dependencies
If additional Android dependencies are required by the project's build, then
the Gradle build will fail due to missing dependencies. To find out what the
missing dependencies are take the following steps.

When calling gradle in the project's build script replace the `--offline` flag
with `--debug` and remove any `-Dmaven.repo.local` arguments.

For the firefox project, comment out the following line in the project's build file:

   export GRADLE_MAVEN_REPOSITORIES="file://$gradle_repo"

Also modify the gradle flags to include the debug option so the download logs will show up:

   export GRADLE_FLAGS="--no-daemon --debug"

Then allow network access during the build by setting
`var/container/disable_network/build` to `0` in rbm.conf, and rerun the build.

Dependent artifacts will show up as downloads in the logs. You can pull out
these dependencies into a list by passing the log file to the gradle dependency
list script in the tools directory:

`./gen_gradle_deps_file.sh /path/to/log/file`

Copy the resulting `gradle-dependencies-list.txt` over the one in the respective
project. Then, in the project's config file, increment the
`var/gradle_dependencies_version` and make sure to restore the project's build
file back to original.
