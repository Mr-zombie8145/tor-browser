### Updating Gradle Dependencies
If additional Android dependencies are required by the project's build, then
the Gradle build will fail due to missing dependencies. To find out what the
missing dependencies are take the following steps.

When calling gradle in the project's build script replace the `--offline` flag
with `--debug` and remove any `-Dmaven.repo.local` arguments.

For the firefox project, comment out the following line in the project's build file:

   export GRADLE_MAVEN_REPOSITORIES="file://$gradle_repo"

Also modify the gradle flags to include the debug option so the download logs will show up:

   export GRADLE_FLAGS="--no-daemon --debug"

then allow network access during the build by setting
var/container/disable_network/build to 0 in rbm.conf, and rerun the build.

Dependent artifacts will show up as downloads in the logs. You can pull out
these dependencies into a list with the following command (replacing
"firefox-android-armv7.log" with the build log file name of the actual project):

`cat logs/firefox-android-armv7.log | grep "Performing HTTP" | grep -o "https://.*" | sort | uniq > download-attempts.txt`

The download-attempts.txt file contains all the attempted downloads, so we need
to find out which ones failed. To do so we try to download all of them first by
using our `gen_gradle_deps_file.sh` script in our `tools` directory:

`./gen_gradle_deps_file.sh download-attempts.txt deps`

Next we want to keep only the successfully downloaded artifacts, remove
duplicates, and sort based on the download URL:

`grep ^[a-f0-9] deps | rev | sort -t/ -u -k1,4 | rev | sort -k 3 > gradle-dependencies-list.txt`

Then add the following three lines at the very top of the dependency list as the
file header (to point to this file and the need for incrementing the dependency
version number as well as specifying the pipe delimited format of the content):

# On how to update dependencies see projects/common/how-to-create-gradle-dependencies-list.txt
# Don't forget to update var/gradle_dependencies_version when modifying this file
sha256sum | url

Finally, in the project's config file increment the
var/gradle_dependencies_version and make sure to restore the project's build
file back to original.

It may also be the case that you wish to clean up old versions of the artifacts.
For this you will need to run the build with a
gradle-dependencies-list.txt file containing only the headers. Make sure to also
comment the GRADLE_MAVEN_REPOSITORIES line from the project's build file. You
can now proceed to reconstruct the list as given above.
